URL Shortener Web Application
About the Project

This project is a URL Shortener web application built using Python and Flask. 
It converts long URLs into short, easy-to-share links and redirects users to the original URLs when the shortened links are accessed. 
The application stores URL mappings in a database and also provides a history of generated links.
